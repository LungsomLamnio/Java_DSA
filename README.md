## 🛠️ Topics Covered

- **Array:** Basic array operations and problem-solving.
- **ArrayList:** Implementation and usage of dynamic arrays.
- **Backtracking:** Solving problems using recursion and decision trees.
- **Bit Manipulation:** Optimization using bitwise operations.
- **Divide and Conquer:** Efficient algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Optimized problem-solving approaches.
- **Hashing:** Implementations using HashMaps, HashSets, etc.
- **Heap:** Priority Queue, Min-Heap, Max-Heap implementations.
- **LinkedList:** Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked List operations.
- **OOPs:** Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java.
- **Queue:** FIFO data structure implementation.
- **Sorting:** Sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.
- **Stack:** LIFO data structure and problem-solving.
- **Tree:** Binary Trees, BST, AVL Trees, and Tree traversal techniques.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their results to avoid re-computation (using memoization or tabulation).
